This tool enables you to customize a 3D foldable paper avatar, and is used in an actual production site!

You can rotate the model by pressing the arrow keys on your keyboard. When the user's browser doesn't support CSS 3D transforms (check performed by Modernizr), the model is still usable in 2D, and can be rotate by clicking the buttons below it.
